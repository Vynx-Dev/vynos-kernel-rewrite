# The VynOS Kernel rewrite
buggy unstable kernel rewrite, im not gonna fill this readme with text rn im lazy so just run the file run.sh using the command `./run.sh` you need qemu and nasm someone please make this a better readme
# Updates
* we got some keyboard input now, but you can only type 33 characters
* we got github actions so now i dont have to keep on spamming nasm and qemu with commands and my laptop can have a lil rest (yes im compiling and building and committing files all on a slow laptop because my main pc is running windows and i need linux for this)
